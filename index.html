            <p class="float-text">UFO conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories which argue that various governments and politicians globally, in particular the United States government, are suppressing evidence that unidentified flying objects are controlled by a non-human intelligence or built using alien technology. Such conspiracy theories usually argue that Earth governments are in communication or cooperation with extraterrestrial visitors despite public disclaimers, and further that some of these theories claim that the governments are explicitly allowing alien abduction.</p>

            <h2>UFO documentaries</h2>
            <p class="float-text">UFO documentaries have long captivated audiences with their exploration of unidentified flying objects and potential extraterrestrial encounters. These films delve into various facets of the UFO phenomenon, from historical sightings and government investigations to personal testimonies and expert analyses.
            One of the earliest and most influential UFO documentaries is "Chariots of the Gods" (1970), based on Erich von DÃ¤niken's book, which proposes that ancient civilizations were visited by extraterrestrial beings. <br> This documentary sparked widespread interest and debate, laying the groundwork for future explorations into the possibility of alien contact.</p>
